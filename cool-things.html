                I spend most of my days lost in thoughts about computers, algorithms, ducks, AI, and natural languages. Honestly, sometimes I get so wrapped up in them that I just have to tinker and build something to bring those ideas to life.  
                After much hesitation (and a bit of courage), I've decided to share the nerdy side of me with you. Here's a collection of the cool things I've built—I hope you enjoy exploring and maybe even playing with them!

                <p>
                    A Turing machine is a powerful abstract model for a computer, proposed by Alan Turing in 1936. The abstraction was designed to model pencil-and-paper computations by a human or other (possibly mechanical) “brain” that is following some prescribed set of rules.
                    Here's a small Turing Machine simulation trying to feed Waquackquack the duck.
